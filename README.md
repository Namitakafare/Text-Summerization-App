# Text-Summerization-App
# LLM-based Text Summarization: Novice to Maestro ðŸš€
A comprehensive guide and codebase for text summarization harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Delve deep into techniques, from chunking to clustering, and maximize the potential of LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

There are two main types:

Extractive: identifies and combines important sentences from the source.

Abstractive: understands the source and rephrases key ideas in a new, concise summary.

1. Built a text summarization app using Streamlit

(front-end) and LangChain (back-end with OpenAI LLM).

2.User enters text: The app accepts text input through a text area field.

3.Text processing: The application splits the text into chunks, creates documents for each chunk, and feeds them into a summarization chain powered by an LLM.

4. AI-generated summary: The LLM model summarizes the text, and the concise output is displayed within the app. Key libraries: Streamlit, LangChain (OpenAI, Document, CharacterTextSplitter, load_summarize_chain).

5.Highlight skills used (e.g., NLP, API integration).
